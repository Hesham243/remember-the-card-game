## 🎯 Description

**Remember the CARD** is a memory-based browser game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
When the player clicks the **Play** button, two random cards are briefly highlighted.  
The player must then select those two cards from memory.

- If both selections are correct: 🎉 **You win!**
- If either is incorrect: ❌ **You lose!**
- The round counter increases on success and resets on failure.

The game encourages focus, memory skill, and fast recall!
